# LeetCode Solutions in Ruby

This repository is dedicated to recording my solutions to LeetCode questions, implemented in Ruby.

## Repository Structure

Each problem has its own directory named `{number}. {Problem Name}/`. Inside each directory you will find:

- `main.rb` — the Ruby solution
- `one_line.rb` *(optional)* — a concise one-liner variant
- `solution.md` *(optional)* — complexity analysis and notes
