# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Create a hash map to store each element along with its row and column indices. Then, create two arrays: one for columns and one for rows. These arrays will track the frequency of how many times each element has been iterated.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(m*n)

- Space complexity:
O(N+M)
