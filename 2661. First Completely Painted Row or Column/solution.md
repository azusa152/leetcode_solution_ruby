# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To create a hash map to store the element with its row and col index
And create 2 array, one is for col and the other is for row.
The arr will store the frequency that the element has been iterated.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(m*n)

- Space complexity:
O(N+M)
