# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To create the hash with the num as key and count as value.
Then sory this hash by value and try to deduct from t.
Then select the count > 0 from hash

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n + m * log(m))
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(m)
